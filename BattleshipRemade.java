/*
 * Before starting the assignment, read through the entire set of directions. This project will take several class periods (approximately 10 hrs.) 
 * so make a plan, don't wait til the last few days and expect to complete this project. 
 * Please use your time wisely. You MUST plan your code using some type of Document creator like Google 
 * Docs (not the code but the pseudocode). I encourage cooperation, a good plan makes writing code easier. 
 * If asked I can help you get your plan started as well as give you ideas.
 * Plan all of your for loops, while loops, if-and-or statements, array declarations, etc‚Ä¶..
 * 
 * 1. Create four 10-by-10 game boards ‚Äì a ‚ÄúShip Board‚Äù for each player (to place ships on), and a 
 * ‚ÄúTorpedo Board‚Äù for each player (to fire torpedoes on). Place a dash (-) in each ‚Äúcell‚Äù of each board.
 * 
 * 2. Start by asking each player to place his/her 3 ships:
 * a. First, display his/her Ship Board.
 * b. The Cruiser and the Destroyer are both 4 cells long; the Battleship is 5.
 * c. You must ask the player where to start placing a ship (for example, Row 3, Column 7),
 * and then asking which direction the ship should go from there (up, down, left, or right).
 * (this will require some serious(SERIOUS) error checking!)
 * d. Assign an uppercase C (Cruiser), D (Destroyer), or B (Battleship) to the cells where a
 * ship is located. (you can be creative here)
 * 
 * 3. Now‚Ä¶let the game begin. Display Player 1‚Äôs Ship Board and Torpedo Board. 
 * Let Player 1 enter the coordinates of the location he would like to fire a torpedo at. 
 * Announce whether he hits or misses. If he hits, place an X in the location of the hit 
 * (on Player 1‚Äôs Torpedo Board, AND on Player 2‚Äôs Ship Board). If he misses, place an uppercase O.
 * 
 * 4. SERIOUS Error checking: do not allow a player to fire at a location he has already fired at; 
 * there are only 10 rows & columns; some directions are impossible.
 * 
 * 5. If a player sinks a ship, announce it. (‚ÄúYou sunk Player 2‚Äôs Destroyer!‚Äù).
 * 6. After Player 1 fires, it is Player 2‚Äôs turn.
 * 7. The players take turns until one player‚Äôs ships are all sunk.
